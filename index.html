        Wayne Enterprises, Inc., also known as WayneCorp and Wayne Industries is a fictional company appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Batman. Wayne Enterprises is a large, growing multinational company.

The American diversified multinational conglomerate is owned and chaired by Bruce Wayne, the son of Thomas and Martha Wayne. Wayne Enterprises is a green company based out of Gotham City and headquartered in Wayne Tower.[1]

Wayne Enterprises and the Wayne Foundation are largely run by Bruce Wayne's business manager, Lucius Fox. Fox makes most company decisions on Bruce Wayne's behalf, since Wayne's time is largely occupied by his duties as the vigilante, Batman.

Wayne Enterprises has been presented in films and television as a business conglomerate, modeled after the standards of a multinational company.

      <h1>About</h1>
      <div class="container-img">
        <img id="tower-img" src="wayne tower.jpg" />
      </div>
      <p>Founded by merchant ancestors of the dead Wayne family in the 17th century as a merchant house, it is among the oldest companies in the DC Universe. The company began as a dozen businesses started by brothers Judge Solomon Wayne and Joshua Wayne. With the revenue generated Judge Wayne essentially built Gotham City by hiring Cyrus Pinkney.[2]

        Judge Wayne's son and heir, Alan Wayne, officially made it a corporate company in the 19th century. Alan Wayne, who was Bruce Wayne's great-great-grandfather, erected Wayne Shipping, Wayne Chemical, and Wayne Manufacturing. All these companies were energized by the world's Industrial Revolution; more branches were created and diversified while others dwindled and subsequently discarded. Along the years, it has developed from a merchant house to a large multinational conglomerate company in the DC Universe; exceeding LexCorp, Stagg Enterprises, and Ferris Aircraft.
        
        Under the control of Patrick and Laura Wayne, Wayne Enterprises became a "green company" and environmentally conscious from that time forward.
        
        After Bruce Wayne returned from the past after a final battle with Darkseid, he revealed that he had been publicly funding Batman for years and founded Batman Inc to publicly fund Batman's allies throughout the world.
        
        Following the end of the Joker War, Wayne Enterprises officially shut down Batman Inc. as a result of Bruce Wayne's choice to publicly fund Batman. Lucius Fox officially regained control of the Wayne fortune but warned Bruce that even if he did return his wealth to him, he would no longer be able to use the companies to fund his crusade as Batman as the board of directors would be monitoring the money. The board also set about attempting to remove Bruce Wayne from active participation within the company and simply pay him a large amount to fund his playboy lifestyle. Lucius Fox is attempting to fight the situation on Wayne's behalf and return his fortune to him with no legal results.</p>

It runs a number of farms and cattle ranches in the Breadbasket regions of the United States, and business was successful in importing Irish products that could be sold at a higher cost in the US economy. 
By 1905, there were five Toole & Sons stores throughout Gotham City. Patrick Toole died at the age of 72 in 1919, leaving the business to his eldest son, Thomas Toole. 
Thomas was keen to expand across the US; however, the outbreak of war in Europe in 1914 severely impacted trade lines from Ireland to Gotham.
At the end of the war in 1918, Toole & Sons Food Merchants was near bankruptcy. Thomas, unable to carry on his father's legacy, committed suicide in 1922 at age 43. 
The second youngest Toole brother, Rory, took over the business and immediately set about selling all company assets in favor of entering liquidation.
<br>
<br>
The business was bought in 1925 by the Wayne family, who were keen to preserve an important part of Gotham's retail history. It is one of the most financially successful divisions at Wayne Enterprises and oldest branches. The business returned to profit in less than a year, and by the end of the second World War, Toole & Sons stores controlled over 60% of all food retail across the city. This was achieved by diversifying the product range and opening up stock to new markets outside Ireland and within the US. The company changed its name to Wayne Foods in 1956. Today, Wayne Foods focuses on the high end market and specialty goods. Although it no longer has the dominance across Gotham as it did from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s, Wayne Foods continues to generate significant revenue for Wayne Enterprises.
